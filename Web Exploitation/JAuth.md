How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: This was a question kinda similar to Cybernotes. Here also they gave credentials for one user i took that token and went to a website for changing things.

Here we can see that there is encoding and user is user so i changed user to admin and then removed some extra part in the token and then when i changed the algorithm to none the fullstop went so i put it back

And ye replacing this token with existing token will give the flag!!
