# Cookies

*Flag:* picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_96cdadfd}

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: I have many ctfs before and so when the question name was cookies i went to cookies section using inspect element and application. After changing values there i realised that for different values there are different cookies and so i checked how many max are there and it was only 25 so i started changing value from 25 towards 0 and i got the flag at the value 18.
