# SOAP

*Flag:* picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_0dcf926e}

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: I didnt understand anything from the hint so i went to the first link provided in the reference provided in web exploitation section and from that i understood how to apply XML external entity Injection. I first intercepted the website using burpsuite and then clicked on details and sent that to repeater there already one xml was already there i just changed it to 
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>

  <data>
<ID>&xxe;
</ID></data>
```
- step 2: And ye when i clicked on send and when i scrolled the response i got the flag there.

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Revised intercepting website using burpsuite
2. learnt to apply XML external entity Injection

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- again i might sound repetitive when i hadnt clicked on hint i was was searching flag in js files using inspect inspect element
