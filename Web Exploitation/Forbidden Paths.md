# Forbidden Paths

*Flag:* picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: When i saw this i realised that this was the one that is simialr to that of pwn.college and so when i saw that they filter out absolute paths i new kind of got an idea that we have to use the relative paths concept.
  
- step 2: I started  by .. and when i clicked on enter it went to a page that was blue and blank so i thought that it went one directory back 
# So i started searching for the flag i searched in 5 places given below
1. ./flag.txt
2. ../flag.txt
3. ../../flag.txt
4. ../../../flag.txt
5. ../../../../flag.txt

And Worray i got it in the fifth one!!!!
