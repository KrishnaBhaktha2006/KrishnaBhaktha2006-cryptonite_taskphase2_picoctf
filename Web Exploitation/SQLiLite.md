# SQLiLite

*Flag:* picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_ec8a64c7}

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: Well i knew what is sql injection so i did a simple sql injection since we wanted to login admin i did
User: admin'-- 
password: password
so what this does is puts user as admin and comments everything else and ye it logged in and on inspecting i got the flag
Actually it said flag is in plainsight so i went to inspecting element and so after that i removed the word hidden and ye i got the flag.
