How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: I pretty much was seeing the source when i came across This "picoplayer355@picoctf.org" So i entered this as email and then for password i went for no sql injections from a website and entered a payload({"$eq": "admin"}) that logged in a website but nothing was there

- step 2: So i opened Burpsuite and sent the login crendentials to repeater and sent to get a response and ye that gave me the base 64 encoded flag!.
