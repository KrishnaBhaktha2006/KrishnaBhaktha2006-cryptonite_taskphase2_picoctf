# SQL Direct

*Flag:* picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_73b0678f}

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: Actually i just opened terminal and pasted like they told then it was written type "\?" To see some commands i was searching for tables command and foound that we can use the \dt to see the list of tables.

Cool
Then i knew basic sql since i had sql in class 12
so after seeing the table i wrote 
```
select * from flags;
``` 
And ye i got the flag

- step 2: Here the terminal output
```

1. Kind of revised basic Sql

Other incorrect methods you tried:
