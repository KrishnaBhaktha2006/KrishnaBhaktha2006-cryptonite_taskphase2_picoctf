How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: This is like 5 rounds of SQli bypass and get the flag.The first roound was or so i just wrote "admin'--" and ye that moved to round 2.

- step 2:Ye here i did this one "admin'/*" and it worked.

- step 3:For this round it didnt talk about \* so i used the same payload.

- step 4: I felt it riddiculus when i saw no using admin itself so i searched up to concatenating strings and this "ad'||'min'/*" worked.

- step 5: This is the last round and seems like the same payload as last time will work and yes it did.
