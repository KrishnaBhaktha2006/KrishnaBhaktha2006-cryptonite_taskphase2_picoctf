# buffer overflow 0

*Flag:* picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: Actually i had some experience in ctfs i had participated in before ctfs and therewere overflow question when it asked input and where hints were like enter 10000 letters and all and so when it asked input and i entered like 19 charcters it gave me flag. Even though the program says near 16 it didnt work for at 17 bytes so when i asked chatgpt it said just 17 wont work so we need to enter a bit more than asked.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define FLAGSIZE_MAX 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE_MAX];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler); // Set up signal handler

  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);


  printf("Input: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1);
  vuln(buf1);
  printf("The program will exit now\n");
  return 0;
}
```

- step 2:These are the commands i used to get the flag
wget

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Sometimes dont think much and try what u might be thinking 
2. Read and understand the program to know the limit to overflow

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- I think i wrong thing i did to solve this question would be to try to run this program vuln.c which wasnt even running.
