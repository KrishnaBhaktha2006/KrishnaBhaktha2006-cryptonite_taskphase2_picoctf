How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: I actually tried a lot i was not able to approach it i tried putting even format strings but i wasnt getting it i was getting just random hex values which when i convert looked like the format specifiers i mentioned then i even tried ghidra and gdb and i couldnt think of anything so i got the solution from a youtube video which i will put in reference.

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. How we need to have patience and check all the hex values
2. How do we Fetch the nth argument from the stack

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- Tried ghidra might be correct but i dont know how to continue.
- Tried pwndbg might be correct but i dont know how to continue.
- Tried even format specifiers and was very close.
