# C3

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1: I saw the ciphertext and encoding program and so i changed somethings which were useless in the encoding program and made it look like this
```
chars = ""



lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char) 
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev)]%40
  prev = cur

print(out)
```
Then i started thinking of its decoding program and reaslised that its going to be the same thing but now lookup1 will be lookup2 and vice versa and - will be +.
```
encoded = ""  # Replace with the encoded string

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

decoded = ""

prev = 0
for char in encoded:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    decoded += lookup1[(cur+prev)%40]
    prev = cur

print(decoded)
```
which when i ran in programiz (online python compiler) gave a output which was another program
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
- step 2: This was one of the insane things i had seen that a programs output was another program. Now when i read the commented things it didnt make sense except "#selfinput" becase atleast last time they had given the ciphertext but this program had no input so from "#selfinput" i thought that the the program itself is the input to the file and there wAS one more comment tag saying "#python2" so i knew i had to run this in pyton 2

- step 3: After this i stored the second program in a text editor and named the file as file.py and then i used the command in the terminal as cat file.py | python2 file.py with this i got the characters which when i enclosed in picoCTF{} i got the flag!!!!!!!!!

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Sometimes we need to understand the encoding program and get the decoding program from it
2. clues will be along the way we just need to observe.

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- i tried putting the ciphertext in the initial program which they had given lol
- i tried putting the ciphertext in the boxentriq cipher identifier
