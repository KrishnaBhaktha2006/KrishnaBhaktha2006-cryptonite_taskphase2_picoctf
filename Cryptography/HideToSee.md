But it took me a lot of time to write that the passphrase was nothing
i tried with nonsense stuff like Atbash, ATBASH, atbash and it didnt work LoL!
and after that i put it in atbash cipher of boxentriq and ye it worked and i got my flag!!

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Revised the extract command of steghide

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- Entered nonsense passphrase even though it was nothing
